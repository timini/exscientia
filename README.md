# exscientia

## Quick start

you need git and docker to run this project.

```
git clone https://github.com/timini/exscientia.git
```

Please bear in mind the repo may take longer than normal to download. This is EXPECTED. Dependancies are checked into the repo to enalble [0-installs](https://yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs). Once clone is complete, run the following commands:

```
# create a local env file using the example as a base
cp .env.example .env

# run db / backend / ui:
docker-compose up
```

Then you can head to:

- [UI - http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- [graphql dev tools http://0.0.0.0:5000/graphiql](http://0.0.0.0:5000/graphiql)

## Overview

The following tools are used

- Yarn 2 monorepo, with graphql server and react frontend split into seperate "packages". In a real project this concept can be extended to other services / component-libraries / testing packages etc.
- Autogenerated graphql server based on postgraphile (graphql types are inferred from postgres schema)
- React / nextjs frontend (with SSR)
- Typescript
- "types" package with typescript tpes autogenerated from the graphQL schema
- docker / compose for packaging
- pretty colours from tailwind / daisyUI
- fancy tables from react-table

## Missing stuff

- tests: I would immediatly add small e2e (smoke) tests for a project liks this to high-level check all services are running and package OK
- CI/CD: githug actions tried to charge me so i didnt add ci/cd
- deployment: with a little work thsi can be deployed as a static site on s3 type thing, or if server is needed it can be deployed with docker / kubernetes / cloud run / whatever
- nice graphs with s3.js - sorry no time
